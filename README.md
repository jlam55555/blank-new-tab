Ever wanted to get rid of the obtrusive Chrome newtab page that covers up your theme background? Now, with the `blank-new-tab` extension, you can cover it up with any image or color of your choice, from the theme or not!

## Features
- Simple, modern UI with only one control element
- Versatile input element:
    - Enter `blank`, `empty`, or leave the input box blank to get a plain, white screen
    - Enter a word or hexadecimal color (such as `blue` or `#abcdef`) to fill the background with a full color
    - Enter an image URL to use an image
    - Enter any other value to get the default image (shown above)

## Usage
- Drag the file from your desktop or a file explorer program onto the "Chrome Extensions" (`chrome://extensions`) page and let the magic happen!
